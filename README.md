# Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage

## Description

This webpage was built with bootcamp students in mind, to collate important information in one place, in an easy to read format.

I was motivated by my own learning to create something which might aid future bootcamp students in their studies.

The project was built as a way for me to implement my own learnings, whilst providing something which can be of use to other students.

I learnt to create a basic webpage framework using HTML; to style the page using CSS; and to make it interactive with JavaScript. I also learnt about an effective Github workflow, which I demonstrated with each new step of the project.

## Usage

The webpage can be used as a guide for students who are learning about each of the topics. It is split into sections with notes on the four main topics of our studies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Github. If we open up the DevTools console, we are able to see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics learned within the prework and will choose a topic for us to study first.
